NO IMMEDIATE PLANS TO CLOSE REFINERY - ESSO SAF ESSO SAF & lt ; ESSF . PA >, the French subsidiary of Exxon Corp & lt ; XON >, said it had no immediate plans to shut down one of its two refineries .
Exxon ' s new president Lee R . Raymond said earlier that it could decide to close a French refinery .
An ESSO SAF spokesman said a closure was a hypothesis that depended on the evolution of the market and refineries ' ability to make money .
He said Port Jerome west of Paris and Fos sur Mer on the Mediterranean had benefitted from new investment over 1985 - 86 and had last year broken even after stock losses .
The Port Jerome refinery has an annual production capacity of seven mln tonnes while Fos sur Mer ' s is five mln , the spokesman added .
Industry sources said the easiest plant to dispose of would be Fos sur Mer because it is a single refinery , while the Port Jerome refinery is attached to a wider complex comprising a petrochemical plant and a lubricant production plant .
Raymond was quoted as saying in a published interview that Exxon was reviewing its worldwide refinery operations and might decide to close one of its French refineries .

Emhart has divested itself of many of its units to focus on three primary markets -- industrial products , consumer products , and information and electronic systems .
Emhart said industrial products should account for about 62 pct of projected 1987 revenues of 2 . 3 billion dlrs , while consumer products should account for about 20 pct of those revenues and information and electronic systems about 18 pct .

HAWKER SIDDELEY CANADA TO SELL UNIT & lt ; Hawker Siddeley Canada Inc > said that , due to poor market conditions for railway freight car manufacturing , it plans to sell its Trenton Works division in Trenton , Nova Scotia .
Hawker Siddeley said it set aside a provision of 7 . 7 mln dlrs for the proposed sale .
It also said lower 1986 earnings were due to much lower earnings in transportation equipment and losses in steel castings and forgings , which offset gains in the mining sector and improvements in forestry equipment .
Hawker Siddeley also said demand for new railway equipment was limited with export sales frequently restrained by customers ' financing difficulties .
Demand for steel castings and wheels for Canadian railways continued to be very depressed with maintenance requirements at the lowest level in the past decade .
However , there was demand for industrial casting due to increased hydro - electric power generation , the company said .
The company said manufacturing of mining machinery and tunnelling equipment showed greatly improved results in the U . S . and export markets , mainly China and India .
The Orenda division maintained a high level of activity in aircraft engine repair and overhaul and in the manufacture of engine components .
Sawmill equipment and skidder operations were affected by a strike in British Columbia and the extended debate on U . S . imports of Canadian lumber , but there were encouraging signs at yearend , the company said .

GENCORP & lt ; GY > GROUP TO SEEK ANTI - GREENMAIL VOTE GAMCO Investors Inc , an affiliate of Gabelli and Co , plans to propose an anti - greenmail provision at the GenCorp Inc annual meeting March 31 , according to GAMCO Chairman Mario Gabelli .
Greenmail often involves the repurchase of shares at a premium by a company from an unwanted investor .
GenCorp today received a surprise tender offer from a group that holds 9 . 8 pct of its stock .
Gabelli also said GAMCO has sent a 13 - D filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission on the 6 . 5 pct of GenCorp stock held by GAMCO and its affiliates .
The stock amounts to 1 , 462 , 000 shares and most of it was reported in an earlier 13 - G filing .
A 13 - G is filed by passive investors to show holdings of more than five pct .
Earlier today , General Partners , owned by Wagner and Brown and AFG Industries Inc , launched a 100 dlr per share tender offer for GenCorp .
Analysts said the offer was between 10 and 20 dlrs per share too low .
GenCorp has made no comment on the offer .
Gabelli said he also proposes that management consider spinning off all assets , other than the GenCorp broadcast properties , to shareholders .
The licenses of the broadcast properties have long been entangled in a series of challenges .
" One thing is going to be clear and that is I ' m going to the meeting and putting up " no greenmail ," Gabelli said .
Gabelli said he fears that greenmail might be a motivation in the offer .
The annual meeting is to be held in Akron , Ohio .
LAENDERBANK EXPECTS MODEST PROFIT RISE IN ' 87 Oesterreichische Laenderbank AG [ OLBV . VI ] expects to maintain its dividend and to record a moderate rise in profits this year after the 181 . 5 mln schilling net profit made in 1986 , General Director Gerhard Wagner said .
Wagner told a news conference that last year ' s 34 . 3 pct rise in net profit from 135 . 1 mln in 1985 was largely due to greater domestic business and wider margins on schilling interest rates .
The bank , Austria ' s third largest , raised its 1986 dividend to 12 pct of its 1 . 5 billion schilling nominal share capital from 10 pct on capital of 1 . 35 billion in 1985 .
Announcing the 1986 results , Wagner said : " We will endeavour to maintain the higher dividend in 1987 .
" Laenderbank ' s balance sheet total rose five pct to 197 . 7 billion schillings against 8 . 1 pct growth in 1985 .
Foreign currency business last year accounted for some 37 pct of balance sheet total compared with about 41 pct in 1985 .
Wagner blamed the realtive shrinkage of foreign business chiefly on the dollar ' s fall against the schilling , which is effectively pegged to the mark .
The dollar ' s weakness had wiped some 8 . 9 billion schillings off the balance sheet total .
Wagner declined to give an exact figure for profits from the bank ' s London branch , which opened in April 1985 , but said that it came close to one mln stg .
On schilling lending , profit on interest had risen 18 pct to 2 . 19 billion schillings while commission earnings climbed 8 . 7 pct to 738 . 9 mln .
According to the 1987 federal budget , the state is due to lower its stake 60 pct in Laenderbank , probably to 51 pct .
Wagner said the exact timing of the move depended on the state .

CUBA TELLS TRADERS SUGAR EXPORTS MAY BE DELAYED Cuba has told international sugar operators who have bought its sugar for shipment in March that these contracts will take second place to Cuba ' s direct shipments to its export markets , dealers here said .
Some traders who have received telexes from Cuba said the language of the message was not totally clear and some believed shipments would be honoured if the traders declare the Soviet Union as the destination of their contracts .
The telexes have fueled rising world prices in the last week and reflect a poor Cuban crop , worry over Brazil ' s export availability , and increasing Soviet demand , analysts said .
Traders said signs of Cuba ' s shortage of immediately available raw sugar to supply its traditional martkets was probably the factor behind Syria calling a snap buying tender last month .
Normally Syria calls white sugar buying tenders for forward delivery , and last month ' s spot requirement resulted in the sale of several cargoes .
Cuba in its telex told operators they would not receive March shipments as Cuba has to meet its contracts to export markets , traders said .

AIR CANADA COURIER BUY SHARPLY ALTERS INDUSTRY Air Canada ' s 54 mln U . S . dlr acquisition of Gelco Corp ' s & lt ; GEC > Canadian unit has dramatically altered Canada ' s fast growing courier industry , largely dominated by U . S . companies until this year , company officials and analysts said .
State - owned Air Canada takes over the country ' s second largest overnight courier business just two months after another Canadian company , & lt ; Onex Capital Corp Ltd >, approved the acquisition of number one ranked Purolator Courier Ltd from New Jersey - based Purolator Courier Corp & lt ; PCC >.
But analysts said the two acquisitions were prompted by financial restructuring undertaken by the U . S . parent companies and likely don ' t represent an industry trend toward buying out foreign owned courier operations .
" It ' s a case of whether you can buy from the right people at the right time ," McLeod Young Weir Ltd transportation analyst Tony Hine commented .
The two acquisitions fit with a larger move by U . S . companies embroiled in a take - over or restructuring to sell - off their Canadian units to generate ready cash , said Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc analyst Harold Wolkin .
" There is a very good correlation between the U . S . parent selling Canadian subsidiaries and the U . S . parent either being under siege or taking someone else over ," he said .
Gelco Corp , of Minnesota , decided to sell Gelco Express Ltd as part of its previously announced program to sell off four operating units to buy back shares and pay down debt , Gelco Express marketing vice president James O ' Neil told Reuters .
The sale is the first under Gelco ' s divestiture program , and proceeds will be used to help pay down 350 mln U . S . dlrs of debt by year - end , the company said .
While company officials declined to disclose earnings and revenue figures , O ' Neil said Gelco Express holds a dominant position in the industry , handling more than 50 , 000 packages a day and generating revenues of more than 100 mln Canadian dlrs a year .
The earlier move by Purolator to sell its Canadian unit formed an important part of a company restructuring program , adopted after another Canadian Company , & lt ; Unicorp Canada Corp >, acquired a 12 . 6 pct stake in Purolator and said it would consider acquiring the whole company .
Last month , Purolator agreed to be acquired by a company formed by E . F . Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers of Purolator ' s U . S . courier business .
For Air Canada , its acquisition of Gelco ' s Canadian courier business represents an " excellent financial investment " in a market it sees growing by 25 to 30 pct annually , spokesman Esther Szynkarsky said .
The airline also announced it acquired a 65 pct stake in EMS Corp , of Calgary , an in - city messenger service .
It did not disclose financial terms , but Szynkarsky said the two acquisitions totalled about 90 mln Canadian dlrs , and the two business have combined yearly revenues of 170 mln dlrs .
She said the acquisition fit with Air Canada ' s strategy of seeking attractive investments that compliment its main airline business .
Gelco will continue to operate with current management , independently of Air Canada , although Air Canada already operates its own air cargo business that includes a small door - to - door courier operation .
" They ' re well run , they ' re a good investment , they ' re doing well in a growing market , and that ' s the way we want to keep it ," Szynkarsky said .
Analyst Hine said the Gelco and Purolator Canadian units will likely retain operating links with their U . S . delivery network , generating traffic for the former parent companies without them having to tie up capital in Canada .
" The nature of the business is that incremental traffic is incremental revenue ," Hine said .
" It ' s sort of a sausage maker business where you put in place the sausage grinder , and the more sausage you can stuff through , the more money you make ," he added .
COPPER INDUSTRY ASKS LME FOR STRATEGY STATEMENT Representatives of the International Wrought Copper Council ( IWCC ) and major copper producers have told the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) a clear statement of its forward strategy would lead to a better understanding between industry and the LME .
In a press release the IWCC said that at the latest meeting between the copper industry and the LME to discuss the new clearing house system , industry expressed grave concern about latest proposals made by at least one LME member for a cash cleared market to replace the planned clearing system which will retain the prompt date settlement basis .
Copper industry delegates told the LME a decision to change ( the planned clearing system ) would indicate a fundamental change in the function of the LME and in its service to the industry , the release said .
By deterring industry use of the Exchange for hedging and physical needs it would remove many of the unique advantages currently offered by the LME and make it indistinguishable from non - trade orientated markets such as Comex .
The LME had to decide whether dealer convenience should take a higher priority over customer satisfaction , industry delegates said .
The IWCC release also said the LME had confirmed that no change would be made to the clearing system planned to start on May 29 .
But it had indicated that consideration would be given in due course to the cash clearing proposal , made by Amalgamated Metal Trading at a LME members meeting last week .
A copper industry spokesman suggested that some assurance of permanence in the new clearing system would remove industry fears of uncertainty resulting from an endless process of review and change , the press release said .

PERU SHORT - TERM TRADE CREDIT UP TO 430 MLN DLRS Peru ' s short - term foreign trade credit lines , regarded as vital to ensure smooth foreign commercial transactions , have more than doubled to 430 mln dollars under the 20 - month government of president Alan Garcia .
Central bank general manager Hector Neyra told reporters many of the credits were 90 - day .
Trade credits were 210 mln dlrs when Garcia took office in 1985 announcing a tough stance limiting foreign debt repayments to 10 pct of export earnings .
Neyra told Reuters Peru was current on interest payments on short - term debt , including trade credit lines and on about 750 mln dlrs in so - called " working capital " credits .
Trade credit lines were 880 mln dlrs in 1982 , but fell in 1984 when Peru stopped some payments to private foreign banks .

DIVISION SEEN ON HOW TO HELP U . S . OIL INDUSTRY The U . S . Congress and the oil industry are deeply divided on ways the government should assist the industry , hurt by the sharp fall in oil prices , and the subsequent growth in oil imports , industry analysts said .
" The industry is deeply divided between those who support an oil tariff and those who believe tax incentives are better ," said Daniel Yergin , director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates , which recently completed a survey of the U . S . Congress on energy issues .
Yergin said he saw mounting support within Congress for tax incentives rather than an oil tariff or import fee .
Today U . S . Energy Secretary John Herington said he will propose tax incentives to increase edomestic oil and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for consideration .
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the proposal would be reviewed .
Herrington said , " I would like to shoot for one mln barrels a day ( addition ) to U . S .
production .
" U . S . oil output was off to 8 . 4 mln bpd in the week of March 13 , down six pct from last year , the American Petroleum Institute said .
Oil industry analysts have forecast oil prices to average about 18 dlrs a barrel for the year and many believe that a move above that level will be unlikey for the near term .
Paul Mlotok , oil analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc said that " even with the rise in prices for the last week or two we ' ve only altered our average price scenerio to about 17 . 50 dlrs for the year .
" Analysts said that at that price renewed drilling and exploration to reverse the decline in U . S . crude oil output will not take place as the companies are waiting for stable prices over 20 dlrs to renew exploration .
John Lichtblau , president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation Inc in New york in recent testimony to Congress said " The continuing decline in U . S . oil production is virtually inevitable under any realistic price scenario .
But the future rate of decline is very much a function of world oil prices and U . S . government policy .
" Lichtbalu said that tax breaks could be used to raise oil production but would only work over time .
" Lowering the producing industry ' s tax burden would probably be a slower stimulant ( to output ) than a price increase but would not raise energy costs .
" Lichtblau said .
But the small independent oil companies who do much of the drilling in the U . S . are looking for the more immediate relief which could be brought on by an oil import fee .
Ronald Tappmeyer , president of the International Association of Drilling Contractors , said , " The members of our trade asssociation are convinced that only a variable oil import fee that sets a minimum price trigger can protect our nation .
" The association represents some 1 , 300 drilling and oil service companies .
The CERA survey of Congress shows that the oil import fee will face a stiff uphill battle .
Yergin said that the poll which was conducted in January by a former Congressman , Orval Hansen , showed support for the oil import fee from 22 pct of the Congressmen surveyed largely as a means of protecting the domestic petroleum industry .
At the same time 48 pct of the Congressmen surveyed opposed the fee with the respondents saying the tariff would hurt consumers and some regional interests .
But 80 pct of the sample said support for a fee could grow if production continued to fall and imports to rise .
Yergin said that imports above 50 pct of U . S . requirements " is a critical , symbolic level .
If they ( imports ) move above that level , a fee may not be legislated but there will certainly be pressure for some form of action .
" But Lichtblau , in a telephone interview , said , " a 50 pct rate of import dependency is not likely to happen before 1990 .
In 1986 U . S . oil imports rose to 33 pct of u . s . energy requirements and shopuld be about 34 pct in 1987 , he added .
TEXSTYRENE & lt ; FOAM > SUSPENDS PREFERRED PAYMENTS Texstyrene Corp said it has suspended quarterly cash dividend payments on its 9 . 5 pct convertible exchangeable preferred stock .
The suspension effects the March 15 payment , and it said it does not expect to pay preferred dividends in the forseeable future .
It said the payments were suspended because of certain covenants contained in its loan agreements .
A spokesman said the company ' s loss of 2 , 115 , 000 dlrs for the first 11 months as a public company did not meet an income condition on the loans , leading to the suspension .
The maker of foam cups , food containers and other products said it had 733 , 332 outstanding preferred shares , which had been privately placed .
The dividend payments on the shares amounted to 1 , 045 , 000 dlrs per year , the spokesman said .
( RPT ) U . S . SAYS TIN DISPOSALS WILL NOT AFFECT ACCORD U . S . tin disposals should have little effect on an agreement reached last weekend by tin producing countries to limit group exports to 96 , 000 tonnes in the year started March 1 , a government official said .
The agreement by the seven - member Association of Tin Producing Countries ( ATPC ) aimed to cut the world surplus and boost prices .
Following the accord , ATPC Chairman Subroto appealed to the United States to restrict its tin releases from its strategic stockpile .
" We don ' t think that ( the U . S . government ) has a large influence in the ( tin ) market at this stage of the game ," said Thomas O ' Donnell , Director of International Commodities at the State Department .
Last year the United States released about 4 , 900 tonnes of tin to two ferroalloy firms .

SHULTZ SAYS U . S . PRODUCTS MUST BE COMPETITIVE Asked what the U . S . State Department ' s policy is on offering subsidized wheat to Moscow , Secretary of State George Shultz told a group of farm leaders that U . S . products must be competitive in the world market .
" If we are going to sell our products , whatever they may be , wheat or anything else , then we have to meet the market ," Shultz told the board of directors for the National Association of Wheat Growers .
" We have to be competitive .
It ' s ridiculous to say that somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same thing at a lower price somewhere else .
They just aren ' t ," he said .
" That is our approach in the negotiations with the Soviets , and it must be our approach as we look at the American farm program and try to figure out what we should do to make it better ," Shultz told the Wheat Growers .
Schultz said that while he does not favor a situation that would allow the Soviet housewife to buy food cheaper than the American housewife , he realizes the importance of American agricultural products being competitively priced .
Speculation has been in the market for some time that the United States is considering offering wheat to the Soviet Union at subsidized prices .
Soviet officials have said they would buy U . S . wheat if it were competitively priced .
Agriculture Department officials have declined to take any official position on the issue .

ARGENTINE MAIZE , SOYBEAN FORECASTS FALL Argentine grain growers reduced their estimates for maize and soybean production in the current harvest in the week to yesterday , trade sources said .
Soybean production for 1986 / 87 is now estimated to reach between 7 . 7 and eight mln tonnes , versus 7 . 8 to 8 . 2 mln tonnes estimated a week ago and eight to 8 . 4 mln tonnes estimated in mid - February .
But even the lowest of those estimates would be 8 . 5 to 12 . 7 pct greater than last year ' s total of 7 . 1 mln tonnes , according to official figures , and would be a new record .
The total area planted with soybeans for this harvest was a record 3 . 7 to 3 . 8 mln hectares and increased 10 . 8 to 13 . 8 pct compared to the 3 . 3 mln hectares planted last year .
The change in yield estimates is due to very high temperatures and inadequate rainfall since early in the year in the soybean - producing belt of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires province .
The heat and lack of rain combined to leave many soybean pods empty , especially in Cordoba .
Intense rains in recent weeks did not affect crops , since rainfall was slight in most main soybean - producing areas .
Rains in the week to yesterday were isolated and weak in Buenos Aires province , totalling between one and 10 mm .
There was no recorded rain in other grain - producing provinces .
With clear skies and seasonable temperatures , fields were able to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recent weeks , allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize , sunflower and sorghum harvesting .
Crops were considered in generally good condition , though it is still too early to judge whether the intense rains of recent weeks caused any long - term damage .
The maize harvest advanced to between 20 and 22 pct of the total area planted , compared to 13 to 15 pct a week ago .
Total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at 3 . 58 to 3 . 78 mln hectares , down two to seven pct from the 3 . 85 mln hectares planted in the previous harvest .
Total production for the current maize harvest is expected to reach between 9 . 9 and 10 . 1 mln tonnes , versus 10 to 10 . 2 mln tonnes estimated a week ago .
The new figure is 21 . 1 to 22 . 7 pct lower than the 12 . 8 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest , according to official figures .
The sunflower harvest advanced to between 20 and 23 pct of total planted area , versus 15 to 18 pct a week ago .
Total area planted with sunflower for this harvest was two to 2 . 2 mln hectares , or 29 . 9 to 36 . 3 pct lower than the record 3 . 14 mln hectares planted in the 1985 / 86 harvest .
The current harvest ' s volume was again expected to be between 2 . 3 and 2 . 6 mln tonnes , or 34 . 1 to 41 . 5 pct lower than last harvest ' s record 4 . 1 mln tonnes .
Yields varied widely from area to area , and growers feared that heavy rains in recent weeks may have taken their toll on crops and , consequently , on total production volume .
The sorghum harvest reached between nine and 11 pct of total planted area , compared to four to six pct a week ago .
Total area planted with sorghum stood at between 1 . 2 and 1 . 3 mln hectares , or 10 . 3 to 15 . 2 pct lower than the 1 . 4 mln hectares planted in the previous harvest .
Estimates for total sorghum production this harvest remained at 3 . 2 to 3 . 5 mln tonnes again this week , or 16 . 7 to 22 pct lower than last harvest ' s total volume of 4 . 1 to 4 . 2 mln tonnes .
RECENT U . S . OIL DEMAND UP 2 . 3 PCT FROM YEAR AGO U . S . oil demand as measured by products supplied rose 2 . 3 pct in the four weeks ended March 13 to 16 . 49 mln barrels per day ( bpd ) from 16 . 11 mln in the same period a year ago , the Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) said .
In its weekly petroleum status report , the Energy Department agency said distillate demand was up 2 . 9 pct in the period to 3 . 43 mln bpd from 3 . 33 mln a year earlier .
Gasoline demand averaged 6 . 93 mln bpd , up 4 . 0 pct from 6 . 67 mln last year , while residual fuel demand was 1 . 31 mln bpd , off 7 . 9 pct from 1 . 42 mln , the EIA said .
Domestic crude oil production was estimated at 8 . 36 mln bpd , down 8 . 1 pct from 9 . 10 mln a year ago , and gross daily crude imports ( excluding those for the SPR ) averaged 3 . 70 mln bpd , up 24 . 8 pct from 2 . 96 mln , the EIA said .
Refinery crude runs in the four weeks were 11 . 92 mln bpd , up 1 . 0 pct from 11 . 80 mln a year earlier , it said .
Year - to - date figures will not become available until March 26 when EIA ' s Petroleum Supply Monthly data for January 1987 becomes available , the agency said .

AMSTUTZ SEES MORE BULLISH WHEAT OUTLOOK IN 1987 U . S . Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz indicated the world wheat supply / demand situation has become more bullish recently because of developments in the world market and increased consumption .
Speaking to a House Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee , Amstutz cited three factors which have improved the wheat outlook .
He said world consumption of wheat is increasing by about 20 mln tonnes this year , primarily for feed use .
There are also reports from Australia , Canada and Argentina that plantings have been reduced , he said .
Furthermore , he cited reports of greater than normal winterkill in the Soviet Union .
" It seems reasonable to expect production and consumption to be in far better balance than a year ago ," Amstutz said .

A YPF statement blamed the drop on momentary problems owing to the summer season but gave no further details .
February ' s production figure fell slightly short of YPF ' s target figure of 2 . 90 mln cubic metres .
Oil production totalled 1 . 76 mln cubic metres last month and natural gas production 1 . 02 mln cubic metres , down from 1 . 95 and 1 . 15 mln cubic metres in January , respectively .
U . S . SOYBEANS HAVE COMPETITIVE PROBLEM - AMSTUTZ Soybeans produced in the United States face a competitive price problem because of the loan rate provisions of the 1985 farm bill , U . S .
Undersecretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said .
Amstutz told a House Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee hearing that soybeans are caught in a " squeeze " because the Farm Bill allowed steep cuts in grain loan rates while limiting the soybean reduction .
As a result , he said U . S .- produced soybeans " have a price problem " in competing with other soybean producing countries .
Amstutz called the situation a " dilemma " for the USDA , and said " we have spent hours in ASCS ( Agriculture Stabilization and Conservation Service ) looking at this .
" He did not say what may be done to rectify the situation .
